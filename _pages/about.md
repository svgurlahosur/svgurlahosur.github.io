Research scholar working in AI and Data Analytics Lab, KLE Technological University. My primary research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, focused on designing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods to automate the network architecture engineering for a given problem with multi-objective optimization. I am involved in the Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India sponsored research project "Crowdsourcing Framework for Digital Archiving and Presentation of Cultural Heritage."

As an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, I teach courses like Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Python & Shell Scripting, and Principles of Compiler Design. I have undergone a training program at Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore, to handle a course on Embedded Intelligence and mentor the student's worklet under the Samsung PRISM program.

I have experience carrying out projects to build custom datasets for real-world problems, design transfer-learning and from-scratch CNN models for computer vision tasks, optimize them as binarized neural networks for edge devices, etc. I have published my work as research papers in various Web of Science and Scopus-indexed book chapters, journals, and conference papers. I have pursued my Master's degree from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, and my Bachelor's degree from Siddaganga Institute of Technology, Tumkur.
